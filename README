Plugin Details
--------------
This plugin overrides the #rand method provided to Array by Rails' ActiveSupport.

It can be used like the method it overrides to return a single value, without passing in a parameter, but if you specify an integer value, a random array of that size will be returned.

Examples
--------
>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand
=> 1

>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand(2)
=> [4, 0]

>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand(2)
=> [1, 2]

>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand(10)
=> [1, 4, 3, 0, 2]

>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand(10)
=> [2, 0, 1, 4, 3]

>> [0,1,2,3,4].rand(-5)
=> nil
